This is a tree map visualizing the S&P 500. The reason I chose to highlight this visualization is because it is a great example of a tree map used to its full potential. It breaks down the market capacities of large companies
split into blocks based on industry, and highlights them based on changes in the stock price. With live updating data, this visualization makes a great research tool for stock market enthusiasts. I think that what this
tree map does best is dividing the stems into their correct categories. The overall market sector contains several subsections, organized in a way where even the overall category and individual share are visible at the same 
time at all times. The tooltips provide more detailed information about each stock while the stock's price change is visible for all but the smallest stocks. By showing the data in this way, finding individual data points is 
easy and understanding where they fit into the whole is intuitive.
