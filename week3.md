This visualization is special because it doesn't show a specific data set, rather being an astract representation of a dataset that is used as an input for a neural network. Even with the growth of large language models and
novel machine learning algorithms, public knowledge of the inner workings of these technologies is minimal at best. Since machine learning algorithms are abstract black boxes even with knowledge of statistics and mathematics,
this topic can be extremely difficult for untrained people to understand. Bringing greater understanding to these topics is a daunting task, but this visualization makes an attempt in a significant way. By visualizing the
logic of the feature data and hidden layers, this interactive tool starts to show how machine learning works in real time. The data point distribution is even showed in its correctly labeled form so that as the algorithm
learns, the descision boundary between the two categories becomes more accurate and defined. Every necessary component is visible, and the most visible components have clear causalities that follow from the data processing of
other neurons. The parameters are highly customizable and show clear differences between different neural network models. More neurons can be added to the network and the weights between neurons can be changed by the user, 
giving full control of the optimization process. I can see this tool being used to teach students the basics of machine learning in a way that is transparent and can be interacted with to give them a hands on experience.
