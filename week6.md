This is a highly interactive and detailed chart tracking employment sector gains and losses. Each sector is stacked with other sectors and ordered from most percentage gained to most lost. Each sector is broken down below the
chart and each sector is highlighted throughout the chart, showing gains and losses for each period. It is a valuable tool for tracking the changes within the job market. Although it may be hard to draw correllations from
just looking at individual sectors, looking at the market overall can reveal big trends. Specifically, looking at recession times reveals that many sectors lose out. However, there are some jobs that are literally recession proof, not losing and possibly even gaining. The best example of this is health care and social assistance. There are some jobs which gain during recessions but tend to lose during normal periods. Most of these are government jobs.
