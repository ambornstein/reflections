I like this visualization because it shows a novel way to display the results of mental health questionnaires. Questionnaires are often used to asses people's experiences, preferences, and complaints. While they are not
usually used to diagnose or definitively determine a person's issues, they can be used to create an overview of reported symptoms and occurences. Collecting a large amount of data through these questionnaires can be easy
but interpreting it is harder. This stacked bar chart shows results in a simple and informative way. By plugging questionnare data into this chart, underlying patterns and comparisons emerge. Since mental health is so
important, I think that innovative ways of displaying common forms of data is crucial and should be constantly iterated on.
